A Modified Matlab Function to calculate the Inverse Kinematics of UR5 Robot. The function calculates the required joint angles for UR5 Robot to reach a certain configuration. 
It utilizes Newton-Raphson Root Finding Algorithm to compute the result. The function reports the calculated joint angles, 
the Forward Kinematics for the particular joint angles and the error in each iteration. 
The function finally creates a .csv file which contains the calculated joint angles in each iteration. 
The .csv file can be used to inspect the Robot's motion in a Simulation software. 
The project is executed as the Peer Graded Assignment of the Modern Robotics, Course 2: Robot Kinematics by Northwestern University, 
part of Coursera's Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control Specialization.

Example execution (Program calculates the Inverse Kinematics while showing each error-canceling steps):
